Stockfolio

This project was a fusion of my interests in finance and technology. Leveraging Alphavantage's API, I integrated real-time stock market data, encompassing price dynamics and relevant information. I created price plots using ChartJs based on historical price data. I also created a portfolio section where users can add/remove stocks to their portfolio which then gets stored to Django's database. This project gave me a deeper understanding of RESTful API's, Django's database structure and data visualization.
